# Road-Accident-Dashboard
## Project Objective

 The objective of the Road Accident Dashboard is to visualize accident data, highlight trends, and identify hotspots, helping authorities and policymakers make data-driven decisions to improve road safety and reduce accidents.

## Data Management
Data management for the Road Accident Dashboard involves collecting, cleaning, and integrating data from various sources to ensure consistency and accuracy. The data is securely stored in a scalable database, transformed for analysis, and visualized in the dashboard. 

## Analysis and Reporting:
The Road Accident Dashboard provides real-time analysis of accident trends, hotspots, and contributing factors. It generates comprehensive reports to aid decision-makers in improving road safety and reducing accidents.
