# Road-Accident-Dashboard
## Project Objective

 The objective of the Road Accident Dashboard is to visualize accident data, highlight trends, and identify hotspots, helping authorities and policymakers make data-driven decisions to improve road safety and reduce accidents.

## Data Management
Data management for the Road Accident Dashboard involves collecting, cleaning, and integrating data from various sources to ensure consistency and accuracy. The data is securely stored in a scalable database, transformed for analysis, and visualized in the dashboard. 

## Analysis and Reporting:
The Road Accident Dashboard provides real-time analysis of accident trends, hotspots, and contributing factors. It generates comprehensive reports to aid decision-makers in improving road safety and reducing accidents.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/Ashokkumar5003/Road-Accident-Dashboard/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Data.xlsx">Road Accident Dataset</a>

## Data Collection
1. **Accident ID** – A unique identifier for each accident.
2. **Date** – The date of the accident (dd/mm/yyyy).
3. **Time** – The time of the accident (HH:MM).
4. **Location** – Specific location details (city, street, GPS coordinates).
5. **Weather Condition** – Weather during the accident (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy).
6. **Accident Severity** – Classification of accident severity (e.g., minor, major, fatal).
7. **Vehicle Type** – Type of vehicles involved (e.g., car, truck, motorcycle).
8. **Cause of Accident** – Primary cause (e.g., speeding, distracted driving, poor road conditions).
9. **Number of Vehicles Involved** – Count of vehicles involved in the accident.
10. **Number of Injuries** – Number of people injured.
11. **Number of Fatalities** – Number of deaths, if any.
12. **Traffic Conditions** – Level of traffic during the accident (e.g., heavy, moderate, light).

## project Insight

1. **Accident Trends:** Analyze accident frequency over time (peak hours, days, or seasons).
2. **Location Hotspots:** Identify areas with frequent accidents for targeted safety improvements.
3. **Severity Distribution:** Examine the severity of accidents to focus on high-risk zones.
4. **Contributing Factors:** Assess common causes like speeding or weather to prevent accidents.
5. **Vehicle and Traffic Analysis:** Explore the relationship between vehicle type, traffic conditions, and accidents.
6. **Weather Impact:** Understand the effect of weather on accident rates for better preparedness.
